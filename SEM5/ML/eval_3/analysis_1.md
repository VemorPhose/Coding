- DBSCAN successfully identified dense pickup regions (clusters)
- The k-distance graph helped determine the optimal eps parameter
- Noise points represent isolated pickups outside main clusters
- Cluster analysis reveals geographical hotspots of taxi demand

Top 3 Largest Clusters:
  1. Cluster 0: 2682 pickups at (0.5254, 0.5883)
     Avg trip duration: 859.18s
  2. Cluster 4: 38 pickups at (0.7785, 0.6751)
     Avg trip duration: 1925.29s
  3. Cluster 1: 37 pickups at (0.7990, 0.6571)
     Avg trip duration: 1781.73s

Noise points represent: 5.07% of all data
Avg trip duration (noise): 786.39s
Avg trip duration (clusters): 919.48s
Difference: 133.09s
Interpretation: Outlier pickups are isolated but not necessarily longer trips

Average Silhouette Score: 0.3764
Min Silhouette Score: -0.9525
Max Silhouette Score: 0.9832
Std Dev: 0.3952

Interpretation:
Cluster Quality: Fair
Meaning: Weak cluster structure, significant overlap
