Stop-and-Wait ARQ is a simple but effective protocol.
It is a type of automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol.
The sender sends one frame at a time and waits for an acknowledgement.
If the ACK is not received within a timeout period, the frame is retransmitted.
This process continues until the entire file is sent.
This is the end of the test file.
