Hello, and a very warm welcome to our corp!

Whether you’re a new player, just new to wormhole life, or just wanted a change; we are very happy that you’ve decided to join us. Now since joining a new group of players means change, we will try to do everything possible to make this transition as smooth as possible. Be it a newbean mining ship for our new players, or help moving stuff for our more experienced recruits. This is all so you can join our community and start earning some of those dank ISK’s you may have heard about in J-space.

But before we get into all that, here are some things you may want to do before we start getting you familiar with our way of life inside Paradise, or PA, as we like to call our home system.

First of all. Remember, this is a game; and we’re here to have fun!  We welcome new players. This means that if you’re a high SP player, or you have a lot of experience, you are expected to share that wisdom, and help our corp along. And for the completely new players reading this; wormhole life is tough, but lucrative and fun! The key is patience, Eve is a looong game.

Required Actions
The following actions need to be performed by you before getting started.

MEDICAL CLONE. We recommend that you set your death clone to Jita IV Caldari Business Tribunal/Caldari Navy Assembly Plant. This will let you suicide back to Jita when you want to go shopping from our home system.

COMMUNICATIONS. We use discord for communication, so you will need a headset/earphones with a microphone, please do not try and use your speakers, this always leads to feedback. You can join us on Discord https://discord.gg/PgAXCY5rkb
Once on discord you need to type an "X" in ithe #request-roles channel for full voice/text access. Also remember to setup "Push to talk" on discord, we recommend middle mouse button, but your choice.

SECURITY REGISTRATION. We require players to associate their alts that are joining corp with their main character. You can do this in the discord #alt-register channel by typing "altname alt for mainname"

NAVIGATION. We use the web tool Pathfinder to track our wormhole connections https://path.shadowflight.org/map/MQ%3D%3D# use your ingame login for access.

Shadow Flight is the ingame share you should connect and online (double click link) for corp bookmarking.
Shadow-Flight-Vets Gives line member read only access to additional tactical bookmarks.

A FEW RULES

Be cool, be kind. No seriously, no personal attacks. No politics/racism/sexism/any-other-ism behaviour is tolerated. Jokes are fun and all, but not in a mean way.. In short order: don’t be a dick.
Please be aware that voice comunication (discord) is mandatory in our corp. This saves time, eases learning, and it also promotes community and discourse. Plus it makes fleet ops smoother and saves lives.
We have a standing fleet, if you're not doing something that precludes you from joining the standing fleet. You should be in it. If there’s no fleet up, create one.

ORIENTATION
1. OUR HOME SYSTEM:  Our home system is J152711 which is a class 4 wormhole system, known within the corp as "Paradise". If there is currently a known entrance (highsec or lowsec) to our system, it will be marked in corp bookmarks as for example:  "-- Tue HS entrance (via c3-s)",  If there is not currently a known entrance, Speak up on comms or ask in corp chat, and we will advise you as to when a new entrance may be avaliable.

Structures: 
The Fortizar: Area 42 Primary defensive structure, used only for defense purposes, do NOT store any assets here.
Astrahus: Pub At The End Of The Universe, keep your assets here, most ops start here.
Azbel: Giga Factory, Manufacturing & Invention
Raitaru: Research, Research & Copying
Athanor: Rox 1, Refinery and Gas processing.


Static Connections:

Static wormhole connections are wormholes that are always present for a given wormhole system, and always connect to the same class of wormhole space,
              
Our home system has two static connections, which gives us a great breadth of user opportunity:

Wormhole ID C247 connects to Class 3 wormhole space
Wormhole ID H900 connects to Class 5 wormhole space

Note, static does not mean the wormholes do not die, The c3 will die after 16 hours and a c5 after 24 hours, they do however immediately respawn with a new sig to the same class of wormhole space. We refer to these wormholes as C3-S and C5-S.


Planetary Interaction:

With 8 planets and almost every planet type, our home system has some of the best planetary interaction available in eve. All the customs offices are owned by us, and in line with our 'not for profit' ethos, the tax rate is 0% We thoroughly recommend that no matter what SP level you are at that you invest some time in setting up PI to get a good passive income coming in which eases the salt considerably when you inevitably lose an expensive ship.


System Status:

We actively use the Message of The Day (MOTD) in the corporation chat window to indicate the current status of the hole, the main information you can expect to see there is:

a) Whether our system is considered open, ie free for anyone to go anywhere or closed, where our wormholes have been rolled shut so we can conduct secure operations in our own system such as mining, ratting or structure deployment. Please pay close attention to this status as nothing will fray tempers quicker than someone opening up what is supposed to be a secure system.

b) Whether there are known hostiles in our system or connected systems.

2. Corp Bookmarking

Wormhole corps live and die by the quality of their bookmarking. It is our primary way of getting around and knowing what sig opportunities exist. So there are two aspects of corporation bookmarking that should be stressed here:

a) Standards, you will find our corp bookmarking standard pinned in the #shadow-flight discord channel. 

b) Scanning out our system and it's connected systems is a collective responsibility, When you login, that should be one of your first questions, "Is there anything needs scanning?"

3. Operations

When the number of people logged on allows, we conduct various operations in a coordinated manner, such as ratting, mining, gas huffing or PvP. Coordinated operations are far safer (and more fun) than individuals doing their own thing. That being said, we also recognise that at times (especially in EU/ASIA Pacific time zones, numbers often do not allow coordinated ops.

Operations will be pinged on discord and sometimes in corp chat message of the day, so keep an eye open and come and join in when they happen.
